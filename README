# aleph-test

This project isolates an issue with aleph websockets where messages larger than 
125 characters cause the server to hang

## Usage

> lein deps
> lein run
> open index.html

This sends a message of 125 characters from the browser which is written to console,
then attempts to send one of 126 characters which hangs aleph, so that the next message
which is again of 125 characters fails to register.
